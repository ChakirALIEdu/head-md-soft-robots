# Survey Results: Cable Usage, Management, and Energy Consumption

## 1. Cable Organization and Management

- **Management Strategies**: Some people don’t organize cables at all; others use simple tricks like keeping cables near power strips or behind furniture.
  - Tools like zip ties, velcro, and clips were common for organizing cables (especially around desks or monitors).
  - Unused cables go in drawers, bins, or are folded with rubber bands.

- **Tangled Cables**: Super common annoyance. Some untangle them manually, while others use labels or color codes.
  - Some people have duplicates (for example, chargers in multiple spots) to avoid unplugging/replugging.

- **Furniture Arrangement**: Many people rearrange furniture to hide cables or reach outlets easier.
  - Some use cable extenders or move furniture closer to outlets, hiding extra cable length behind objects like bookshelves or desks.

## 2. Energy Consumption and Power Outlets

- **Outlet Placement**: Outlet locations seriously impact furniture arrangement. People use extension cords or power strips when outlets are inconvenient.
  - There’s a desire for more outlets or better placement, especially in older homes.
  - Some suggested adding outlets higher up on walls for easy access.

- **Charging Habits**: Phones, laptops, desktops, and lights are the most used devices.
  - People charge phones overnight or centralize charging for multiple devices using power strips.
  - Wireless devices (like earbuds) are a favorite to avoid tangled cables.

- **Battery Anxiety**: Many feel dependent on their devices’ battery life, which creates anxiety when they’re low on charge.

# Key Takeaways:

- Cable management solutions vary—from minimal effort to using zip ties and color labels.
- Outlet placement controls how people arrange furniture, often needing power strips or extenders.
- Wireless devices are preferred to avoid tangled cables.
- Managing energy (especially mobile devices) is crucial for daily comfort and mental clarity.

# Design Priorities for Cables

- **Flexibility**: People want more flexible cables to avoid tangles.
- **Durability**: Frayed cables are annoying. Braided ones are better for durability.
- **Length**: Longer or adjustable cables are preferred since most find standard ones too short.
- **Color and Aesthetics**: Some want customizable colors, while others prefer neutral tones to blend in.
- **Ergonomics**: 90° connectors and retractable cables are popular for reducing strain.
- **Material**: Braided/woven cables last longer and are more durable than rubber ones.

# Integration into Spaces

- **Furniture with Built-in Cables**: People like the idea of built-in cables for neatness, but worry about inflexibility and replacement issues.
- **Retractable Cables**: This could keep things flexible and tidy at the same time.

# Pain Points and Improvements

- **Tangled/Fraying Cables**: Biggest complaint—cables tangle and fray too easily.
- **Too Many Cables**: People feel overwhelmed and want more universal or wireless solutions.
- **Outlet/Plug Issues**: Outlet placement and bulky plugs are common annoyances.
- **Sustainability**: Some want durable and recyclable cables, but there's little awareness about their environmental impact.

# Potential Solutions

- **Retractable Cables**: Could fix length issues and tangling.
- **Universal Standards**: USB-C is praised, and people want more consistency across devices.
- **Durable Materials**: Promoting braided or reinforced materials to increase cable lifespan.
- **Smart Design Integration**: Combining neatness (built-in) with flexibility (retractable or modular designs) would be ideal.
