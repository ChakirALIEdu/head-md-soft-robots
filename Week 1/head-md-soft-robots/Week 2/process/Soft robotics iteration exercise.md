# Observation Notes: Classroom Visit
- Impromptu visit made me notice trends in spatial awareness.
- Delegates stood in a semicircle, fanning out from the center.
- They hugged the walls, and used furniture for support.
- Created a wide, untouched space behind them, almost like a boundary.
- Bags always went on tables or lockers—never on the floor.
- People used their bodies to hold jackets or bags, signaling they wouldn’t take up more space.
- Body language was closed off—like they were trying not to intrude on others' space.
- The whole setup felt awkward and unplanned.

## Reflections on Space and Territoriality

- How people position themselves speaks volumes without words.
- Ties back to Edward T. Hall’s idea of hidden, unspoken territorial behavior.
- Humans, like animals, claim space unconsciously. It’s not an active  choice per se—it just happens.
- Despite different cultures (South America, Asia, etc.), everyone here positioned themselves similarly to what I see in Switzerland.
- The way space is used reflects cultural values, but also how interior design influences our movements.

# Notes on Enzo’s Place

- **Enzo, my first subject for observation**: middle school teacher, studying Math & Physics Master’s.
- Lives in a 2.5-room studio in Geneva.
- Spends most of his time in just a third of his room (for sitting, lying down, working, sleeping).
- Bad storage setup—important stuff is on the ground or waist-level; less important things are stored overhead.
- He sees his place as temporary and doesn’t want to pay for repairs.
- Style: minimalist, practical. Focuses on function but likes colorful, decorative lamps.
- Complains about bad ventilation and poor sensory comfort.
- Cables are everywhere—no real cable management ---> Really led me down a cable pipeline. Why were his cables like that?

# Cables and Cable Management

- Cables take up a lot of space and impact where we put furniture.
- In one design room, I counted 15 outlets and cables, yet the space still felt cramped.
- Cables are designed for safety (thick, insulated), but they’re clunky and control desk/wall distances.
- People try to hide cables for aesthetics (in floors, walls, or behind furniture).
  
## Observation on Outlets:

- **1st-3rd floors (HEAD)**: People sit closer to walls and outlets, creating islands around power sources.
- **4th floor**: Outlets are embedded in the floor, allowing more flexible, spread out seating.

## Practicality of Cables

- I prefer wired earphones over Bluetooth—feels more secure (they catch my phone if it falls), and they’re more reliable.
- But cables can be a tripping hazard and annoying to untangle.

# Cables in Social Settings

- In places like restaurants or kitchens, outlets and cables are hidden to promote not using devices while eating.
- Outlets only show up when needed (e.g., in hospitals).

## Analogies for Cables

- Cables remind me of snakes, hooks, threads, lifelines.
- Thinking about cables as threads—if they were thin enough, a cat could choke on them.
- Imagine threading a table with cables—that’s a quirky image.

Then I sent a survey...
