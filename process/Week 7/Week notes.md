# Rhino

Advanced the shape of the project, the form, the measurements,  and did an optional module for the cable to be pushed through, and the electronics to be in.

# Programming 

Worked on keeping the makeshift camera sensor and raspberry pi to remain stable. Managed to keep the setup stable for longer than 5 minutes, which is a good thing. The code refreshes the cache and only checks a few frames a minute for motion. It's not the best, but for a duration, i'ts commedanble that I managed to accomplish this. 
The connection with the arduino also works as well. My initial issue came from the connection between the arduino's processes, the usb cable and the other files. 
Evidently, this was also fixed, but perhaps the problem also lies with the bits being sent to the arduino. I suspect they're not bits and hold too much information. 
Will have to redo the code a bit for the motion sensor; there are ways to make everything go quicker

# Research 
Advanced the logic of the robot, its different scenarions, did a video exploring its different positions, reactions, expressions. Repurposed the logic of the project: let's turn cables into design objects or at elast part of one. It just adds on the previous "implicit boundary" notion we had earlier.


# Review for myself 
I personally really enjoy the programming part. Getting the motion sensor to work with my old USB camera was wonderful. and thrilling. I separated the camera into 6 regions but and those regions reflect the placements of each servo/robot. It would be nice if the technology required could be minimal, as minimal as possible.
