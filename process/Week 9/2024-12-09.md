# Polishing my documentation

At the state I'm at, I really slacked on my documentation. I need to keep up with my won work. I went back and redid some notes a bit. Will revisit those things eventually. I feel i'm working myself to the bone.
Having a bit of a panic attack but I'll be fine.

# Shape of the object

Further polishing the shape of the robot on Rhino8... I'm not certain how I want to do things yet but I think I can make it.
