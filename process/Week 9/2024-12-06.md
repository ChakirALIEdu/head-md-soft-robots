# great so good news
my servo motors turn 360° so i don't need to buy new ones
but i don't need 360° servo motors anymore.
so i'll have to have to fix that.
and also. i need a good power supply for those servos
so an external usb power bank. i already have a power supply module which helps. but i need to get that other thing.
if i keep using my arduino to provide power, i'm going to accidentally burn a circuit and break the machine...
