# Brainstorming sessions

- Brainstormed with Bruno, and Ayoub on their projects
- Brainstormed with me with everyone else, on my project
- Only thing that came out was that my proejct was severly lacking
- Obviously I'm not in a good mood as a result
- Obviously I'm feeling defeated because it feels like my entire project means nothing
- Not fun at all
- I've taken pictures of the notes and brainstorming
- They're now in GIT

- I'm feeling extremely lost, and I had expected it somewhat.
- Tomorrow is another day.
