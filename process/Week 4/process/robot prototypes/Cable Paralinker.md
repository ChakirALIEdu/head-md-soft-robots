# Cable Paralinker
## Concept
A colony of robotic sections that latch onto cables at home, and use their spines to move away from the users.

## Where does it exist? 
On the ground, wide open areas in which cables may reside in open view

## For who is it?
People who typically trip on cables a lot. Diabetic people, like my dad, who trips a lot.

## How does it work?
Each section is equipped with small motion sensors or proximity sensors and detects how close the user is. The closer they get, the more the spines move in a direction opposite to the user, scurrying away and making noise as they do. 

## How does the user interact? 
They first need to locate cables they often trip on, and latch those sections along their lengths, spread out however they'd like. Then, with the proximity and movement, the spines move away and make noises, averting the users of their general location. 

## For what reason is the interaction taking place?
To prevent accidents, tripping, and the like, the machine ensures that cables are never forgotten, raising the user's awareness of their presence, even during their laziest time.
