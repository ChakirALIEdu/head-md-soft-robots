# things to do: 
reformulate the programming
3d print
Zund cut file preparation (and paper)
short presentation preparation 

later: fix documentation
those things are feasible
right also a new stick for the servo. that's unedniably the most important part
a chain-like system perhaps? 3 segments?
3d print (top case, bottom case, servo arm, top of arm, case for camera)
illustrator file adjusted for size for the little gnomes and the camera case (cutout the holes in illustrato. mark the holes for the cable also)

fritzing and electric model
documentation...

change the orientation of the camera case when printing, reduce its width by 3mm

servo arm needs to be a tighter fit.

reprint bottom case. there needs a 0.3mm margin i think with the case
