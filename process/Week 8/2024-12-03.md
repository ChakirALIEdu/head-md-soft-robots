# Base module
Advanced the module a bit more and 3D printed it, scaled down by 2,4.
Might keep that scale, which is also exact with the scale around the paper.

To create smaller double, scale down by 2,4
Provisational shape, the inside could be fashioned into smth else. actually try drilling a hole in the shape.



critics of my shape of the robot -->

Close up the eyes
Make it look less like a KKK hat maybe.......................................
clip for the cable to remain? (in the paper?)
recut the model

Things to do -->

3D print other base for bigger models
3D render objects in a setting
Do a little animation showing how they behave
Storyboard
Finish editing that shitty video you had with your interactions lol


You'll think of the robot mechanisms later. You can show different ways it moves in the little video. It matters not. The detection mechanism has been finished and tuned up. Now the only thing left is figuring out how a single servo can move all those parts. You can do it. The issue is make sure those objects can be mass produced without using too many materials. You thrive under restrictions; you'll do it. 

+ order of importance


Also finished the video of the project's scenario. The samll scale one.
