## Objectives
Test if the reactions and the expressions of the cables work.. See if people notice that trhis is truly an appendage of the cable and not an addon. 
# Critical tasks to do
Put the object around cables and observe their movements around cables

## Believable Scenarios
- Try to scare the cables
- Pull the cables
- Place the object where it's supposed to go
- Scare it
- Soothe it
- Leave it alone
- Say hi

## Why, what, when, where, who
Why? See if people understand the thematics and interactions. Check interpretations. Witness the project in a vaccuum.
What? Motion sensor around the movements
Where? Close to the ground, lit area, foisonnant de cables 
When? you are asking too many questions here. Any time they move cables or move around. Think it would be interesting to place ky object around a bottleneck spot
Who? Anyone who doesn't already know what my project is about. See if the shape looks wrong

## Setup
Need to record, place it around a spot people often go around, cut areas with cables. Mostly videos of the interactions and interviews and interactions.
