# Colony Talker
## Concept
A tower with multiple tendrils connected to light and vibrating pallet, sprawled out all around a room, following existing cable disposition. It translates your movement around a room into language.

## Where does it exist? 
At the epicenter of the space you spend the most of your time in.

## For who is it?
Users of all ages and backgrounds, that wish to have a more organic, living relationship with their house and how they live.

## How does it work? 
The tower, the center of the colony, records motion around a room over a course of time, via its many tendrils. After it is done recording, it emits messages in the forms of sounds and symbols, communicating with the user(s) with the language of their movements. 

## How does the user interact? 
The user turns on the machine, and lives as they usually do. At the end of the day, they interact with the machine by pressing a button, and it then prints out a coded message that is the spoken representation of their life within their home.

## For what reason does the interaction take place?
Your movements triggered its analysis.
