# Firewall Extender

##  Concept
Malleable cardboard sticks are attached to the end of flat surfaces, like door frames or the edges of tables, and work to extend them. They "open and close" the closer and faster someone gets nearer.

##  Where does it exist? 
On the borders of flat surfaces. Walls, tables, etc.

##  For who is it?
Those that desire to extend the surface area of their workspace and those that wish to create new "doors" to set further boundaries.

## How does it work? 
Countless sticks are adorned on the edge of, for example, a table. Those sticks rise up when you get nearer, due to its motion censors detecting your closeness. They rise up to 90°. They remain this way for a while and can be locked into place. When approached suddenly, they tilt upwards to 270° and deploy their cushions hidden underneath, protecting people from hitting themselves on the edge of a table.

##  How does the user interact? 
The user sets the strip of sticks all along an edge and turn it on. Motion sensors on different points calculate how near someone is, and formulate their movement output. The movements of users instill those reactions.

##  For what reason does the interaction take place?
User desires more space, or a new wall, and the house and furniture extend a helping hand and respond in kind.
