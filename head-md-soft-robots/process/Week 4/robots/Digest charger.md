# Digest Charger
## Concept
A sea anemone-like creature that takes hold of your electrical appliances that are out of batteries, and digest them to charge them until they are back at 100%.

## Where does it exist? 
Near outlets and plugs.

## For who is it?
Those that are plagued with battery anxiety or dependency benefit most from it.

## How does it work? 
The malleable surface of the Digest Charger swallows the machine and uses wireless charging systems to charge the battery of those appliances or wearable.

## How does the user interact? 
The user sets their electrical objects, such as a phone, into the machine, that tenses back up to cover the object and keeps it tightly closed within its "digestive system", protecting from further harm or usage.

## For what reason does the interaction take place?
To charge their batteries in a gnarly, organic way that is off-putting.
