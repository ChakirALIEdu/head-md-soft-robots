# Mat Seeker

## Concept
A mechanical rug that always point towards a person's or an object's Geo-localization selected by the user.

## Where does it exist? 
Meditative areas, open spaces like living rooms, places where rugs would be.

## For who is it?
People that want their home to be inhabited by themselves or someone else, even in their absence. Alternatively, people that want a prayer mat that always points towards the Qibla, quickly and precisely.

## How does it work? 
Along the sides of the rug are different geo-localizations sensors that send signals to the little legs on each of its corners to move. It calibrates and rotates itself from its center to turn and always face a specific direction. The Geo-localisation data it tracks can be sent to be anything; a moving object or a fixed position.

## How does the user interact? 
The user sets a location the rug should track by interacting with the buttons of the side of the rug. Then, they unfold the rug and place it down, and it shall follow and correct itself to have it's red side point towards the object. A specific compass made for one target.

## For what reason does the interaction take place?
For Muslims that pray, it serves as a quick and easy tool to always remain facing the same area. The interaction fills a purpose. Aside from that, it also allows the user to know how much they or someone/something else is moving, from within their home.
