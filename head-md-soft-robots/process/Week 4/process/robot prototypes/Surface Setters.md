# This is my wall, it was made for me

## Concept
A colony of walking standing sticks that hold paper curtains. Those walking curtains become malleable and interactive room separators (living paravent).

## Where does it exist? 
Within spacious rooms, and spaces that require to be shared and reorganized again and again.

## For who is it?
People that live in transient, shared spaces, constricted to share spaces and their privacy with moving people.

## How does it work? 
- The colony of sticks, once activated, reacts to its proximity to the user and near objects. It moves to get further as further away as possible from anything. 
- Once set in place, it creates organic separators using optimized space separation. Occasionally circles you and entraps you within it.

## How does the user interact? 
The user turns on one machine, lets it move, unloads its curtain and connects it to the next machine, which repeats the process. Over time, it creates a new room.

## For what reason does the interaction take place?
-  4 walls within your own rooms are not enough to further yourself away from the world.
- Add more walls.
