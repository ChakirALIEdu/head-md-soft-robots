My name is Chakir. ALI  Chakir. My last name is ALI if that wasn't clear.
I'm not sure who will find this note, but if you do, then... Hello.

Today is Friday. I was expecting to be able to go to the mosque, but I only went there, prayed Sunnah instead of Jummuah, stayed for 5 minutes during the preach, and had to leave.
I had an appointment at 1pm. I had to leave relatively quickly. 
Besides, we were at full capacity at the mosque. I figured if my presence was going to be an inconvenience for both me and other people, then it would have been best for me to leave. I still regret it, but Allah knows I went and tried to stay. If the world were just, I wouldn't be punished for staying.

Alas.

I'm STARVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING.

# I need a moment.

Thinking back to my itnerview at my job where I was offered cookies for free right before the interview. Ya Allah, Alhamdulilah, I had it so easy. So many blessings indeed. That cookie was crazy good too. Should have taken the whole batch.

Here's a link to a picture of a cookie.

Tasty. The one I'm remembering was less saturated. It was mostly due to the lighting washing the colors away, and my memory. They're also probably oversturating cookies in post.
