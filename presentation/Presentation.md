## Area of Intervention
Our relationship with cables

## Research Question

What roles do cables play in visualising/defining boundaries and dependencies to energy?

How does battery dependency and cable placement affect our movement, anxiety, and spatial awareness within domestic contexts? TRhe way we understand/define waht it means to be at home etc



## Research

Observations focused on shared living spaces, mine or friends', trying to answer the following question:
### Why are objects placed where they are?

The culprit was always related to cables and outlets in some way.

Through observations, user surveys, user interviews, observational drawings, and mapping exercises, I explored how individuals perceive and interact with cables in their daily routines.

Survey responses reflected mixed approaches to cable management, with many participants either tolerating visible cables or organizing them only when they became obstructive. Responses also highlighted dependency on battery life, particularly for essential devices, impacting daily habits and positioning within spaces.
 
 Users expressed a preference for flexibility, durability, and cable length, with some showing openness to new designs, but only if they improved convenience.

## Insightss

- Cables can serve as implicit spatial dividers, invisible boundaries that divide areas into sections...
- Battery anxiety shapes user behavior, with people developing routines and stress around charging devices...
- Cables form a tethered extension of the self, where individuals' reach and "existence" extend to the length of the cables they'rer connected to, influencing their perceived comfort zones...


## First Ideas & Prototypes

### **Cable Paralinkers**
A colony of robotic sections that latch onto cables at home, and use their spines to move away from the users.

### **Digest Charger**

A sea anemone-like creature that takes hold of your electrical appliances that are out of batteries, and digest them to charge them until they are back at 100%.

### **Boundary Extenders**
Malleable cardboard sticks are attached to the end of flat surfaces, like door frames or the edges of tables. They "open and close" the closer and faster someone gets nearer, playing with and reshaping the boundaries of their intervention on the world.

## Next Steps

Focus on refining the prototypes to emphasize on the following points:
- Answering the questions better - Am I trying to erase the rules, ennhance them? Change the way we move? Should I create a new space, devoid of any cables? What words do we use to defines those areas?
- What would the world look like with new movements around cables? Pulling, stretching, retracting, loosening, cutting, squashing...?
- Emphasize user interaction.
